This sub-folder contains files that successfully create a seamless line ofcommunication following this path: 
DHT --> Arduino --> ESP8266 --> ThingSpeak.

Please follow these steps attentively:

1) follow this link, and click the green button labelled "clone or download", then click "Download ZIP".

2) Go to the arduino IDE taskbar -> sketch -> include library -> add .ZIP library, then browse to find the library you just downloaded
  from github. The green (I think, but it could be anything cause i'm colorblind) status bar at the bottom should say "library successfully
  added or something similar.
  
  
3) Connect the DHT to the arduino. N.B: the signal pin of the DHT should be connected to digital pin 2 on the arduino. Wait until codes 
  are uploaded to connect the wifi module with the arduino.
  
4) Go the DevelopmentArena/ PoC/OneLineAttempt1.0/Arduino, copy and paste the code in the IDE, set the port and COM to the Arduino Mega
  and upload the code. N.B: You should uncomment the define that corresponds to the DHT you're using
  
 5) Go to DevelopmentArena/ PoC/OneLineAttempt1.0/ESP8266, copy and paste the code in the IDE,set the port and COM to whichever ESP you're 
    using and upload the code.  N.B: You should put your own SSID and password.
