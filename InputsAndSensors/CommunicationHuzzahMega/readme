->This test creates a serial channel Serial1 to exchange data between the ESP8266.
->It has been tested using a NodeMCU ESP8266, an Arduno MEGA and a DHT11 and has been noted to yield successful results.
->It is suspected that the HUZZAH feather has different configurations than the NodeMCU, hence the code needs to be tested again in the UK.

STEPS

->Begin by opening the MEGA code folder, copy the code and paste it in the Arduino IDE, go to tools and selct the board (Mega) and port,
  and upload it to your arduino.
->If you haven't already conneected your DHT with your Arduino this might be a good time to do this. Open the serial monitor to check if 
  temp and humidity data is being read.
